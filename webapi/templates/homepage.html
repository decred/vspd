        <h1>VSP Overview</h1>

        <p class="pt-1 pb-2">A Voting Service Provider (VSP) maintains a pool of always-online voting wallets,
            and allows Decred ticket holders to use these wallets to vote their tickets in exchange for a small fee.
            VSPs are completely non-custodial - they never hold, manage, or have access to any user funds.
            Visit <a href="https://docs.decred.org/proof-of-stake/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docs.decred.org</a>
            to find out more about VSPs, tickets, and voting.
