## Design decisions

- [gin-gonic](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) webserver for both front-end and API.
  - API uses JSON encoded reqs/resps in HTTP body.
- [bbolt](https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt) k/v database.
  - Tickets are stored in a single bucket, using ticket hash as the key and a
    json encoded representation of the ticket as the value.
- [wsrpc](https://github.com/jrick/wsrpc) for dcrwallet comms.

## MVP features

- VSP API as described in [dcrstakepool #574](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/issues/574)
  - Request fee amount (`GET /fee`)
  - Request fee address (`POST /feeaddress`)
  - Pay fee (`POST /payFee`)
  - Ticket status (`POST /ticketstatus`)
  - Set voting preferences (TBD)

- A minimal, static, web front-end providing pool stats and basic connection instructions.
- Fees have an expiry period. If the fee is not paid within this period, the
  client must request a new fee. This enables the VSP to alter its fee rate.

## Future features

- Write database backups to disk periodically.
- Backup over http.
- Status check API call as described in [dcrstakepool #628](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/issues/628).
- Accountability for both client and server changes to voting preferences.
- Consistency checking across connected wallets.
- Validate votebits provided in PayFee request are valid per current agendas.
